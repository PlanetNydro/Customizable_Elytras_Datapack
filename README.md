# Nydro's Customizable Elytras Data Pack
Nydro's Customizable Elytras is a data pack that adds over 3,000 new elytra styles.

This data pack adds the ability to dye elytras, as well as custom armor trim textures that you can apply to your elytra. Its a pretty simple concept.

Currently works with version 1.21.4 snapshots
